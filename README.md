# CClynx 🐆

_Codename: CClynx — Educational C Compiler (pre-alpha)_

---

## Overview

**CClynx** is an experimental C compiler built as an educational project.

The main goal is not just to compile but also to **reveal the internals** of compilation:

- Show **tokens**
- Show **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**
- Generate **Three Address Code IR (Intermediate Representation)**
- Produce **ARM64 assembly** (without any optimizations)

Currently, the project is **pre-alpha** and primarily a learning tool.
